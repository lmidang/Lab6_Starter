When I bite into them they taste a bit odd like it\u2019s missing something. But when we start eating it, it starts to taste good. It\u2019s weird but that\u2019s how it turned out. BUT I had salted butter instead of unsalted and I used light brown sugar. So that could have altered the taste a bit but I was just using what I already had at home","reviewRating":{"@context":"http://schema.org/","@type":"Rating","ratingValue":4,"worstRating":1,"bestRating":5}},{"@context":"http://schema.org/","@type":"Review","datePublished":"2020-08-22","author":{"@context":"http://schema.org/","@type":"Person","name":"XxTurtlexX"},"reviewBody":"I made them into muffins and my kids loved them for their birthdays and I would totally use them for any occasion","reviewRating":{"@context":"http://schema.org/","@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5,"worstRating":1,"bestRating":5}},{"@context":"http://schema.org/","@type":"Review","datePublished":"2020-11-24","author":{"@context":"http://schema.org/","@type":"Person","name":"JefftheChef"},"reviewBody":"This recipe works best with patience.  Butter is an absolute must, but to make the cookies taste even better, remember sifting, and to make it easier, use the wire whisk attachment on your mixer.  I was given this tip by a friend of mine who makes fantastic cookies.  Add all of the dry ingredients to your mixer FIRST (I have a KitchenAid), and let it whisk (sift) for a few minutes.  I also used parchment paper on my pans, which means no need to oil your pan, and baked them for 9 minutes.  My whole family was raving about them when they were done, and they tasted even better the next day!\nThe cream cheese idea sounds fascinating.  If anyone has tried, let me know what you think!","reviewRating":{"@context":"http://schema.org/","@type":"Rating","ratingValue":4,"worstRating":1,"bestRating":5}},{"@context":"http://schema.org/","@type":"Review","datePublished":"2020-01-08","author":{"@context":"http://schema.org/","@type":"Person","name":"TaTa\u2019s GoTo","givenName":"TaTa\u2019s","familyName":"GoTo"},"reviewBody":"WOW!
