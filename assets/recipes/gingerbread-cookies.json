I don\u2019t own a hand mixer or a stand mixer so I just mixed with a whisk and a wooden spoon. These cookies turned out great! I found that 6 minutes was just enough time for baking them in my oven as it runs hotter than most. They are a hit! I love this recipe and I will be making them again! I also used vegetable oil instead of butter because the only butter I have is frozen.","reviewRating":{"@context":"http://schema.org/","@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5,"worstRating":1,"bestRating":5}},{"@context":"http://schema.org/","@type":"Review","datePublished":"2019-12-24","author":{"@context":"http://schema.org/","@type":"Person","name":"GoldRadio"},"reviewBody":"This was my first time trying this with my gf we started doing this at 4pm on Saturday then realized the directions said they had to go in fridge for 2-3 hours and she had to work at 7 so i took her to work and decided ill try to bake them myself. Welllllll it started off with me taking the dough out putting it all in a pan just to then realize i forgot to put the parchment paper or something down under the dough. Got mad ran to giant eagle since its 10 seconds from my house got back 5 minutes later to find out there was a reason it needed to be in the fridge for 2-3 hours cause now it was sticky and i couldnt form it. So i put it back in the fridge and went to my room called her and told her im done and she can do it when she comes back over. Now its monday and i said ill give it a second try since shes with her family. And i got it on the sheet made a make shift roller out of a can cut it out and now im about to throw it in the oven. This tasks takes alot of patience. P.S. also will be my first time even eating gingerbread men.

I followed this recipe to the letter, left it to chill an extra hour (4 hours total) It was still SO sticky! I attempted to roll it out and it melted in to my counter. I had to use a metal spatula to remove it. No matter how much flour I added, it didn't help. I ended up just making rough circles and cooking those. I cooked them for 16 minutes and they kind of came out? I haven't tasted them yet, but this was super stressful!

I've had nothing but positive feedback from everyone who tries them. \nSome have commented that the dough is too wet, but you can get around that by mixing in more flour, or returning the dough to the fridge. take it out in small portions to reduce the time it sits out before being cut. Plus the softness means it re-kneads really well as well so you end up being able to use it all.  \nI didn't decorate mine with icing as it looked too amateur with my icing skills. Instead I put colored sugar sprinkles on the tips of the Christmas trees, hands of the angels etc, and this looks Christmassy enough. Do that before baking or they don't stick. \nSo good I made another batch, this time without enough Molasses so I made up the volume with regular golden syrup and they were fine.","reviewRating":{"@context":"http://schema.org/","@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5,"worstRating":1,"bestRating":5}},{"@context":"http://schema.org/","@type":"Review","datePublished":"2021-01-12","author":{"@context":"http://schema.org/","@type":"Person","name":"Voldemort"},"reviewBody":"Great recipe!
